A DBMS has appropriate languages and interfaces
to e database queries and updates. Database
languages can be used to read, store and
update the data in database. Types of database
languages:
-- 1) DDL 2) DML
3) DCL
4) TCL
1) Data Definition language. It is used
to define database structive or pattern. It is
used to create schema, table, index, etc.
in database. Using DDL statements, you
can create skeleton database.
of
2) DML : Data Manipulation language. It
is used for accessing and manipulating
data in database. It handles user
requests. Some tasks: Select. It is used
to retrieve data from database. Insert.
It is used to insent data into table.
Update: It is used to update existing
data vion within a table
3) Data Control language: It is
used to retrieve the stored or saved
data. The DCL execution is transaction-
al. It also has rollback- parameters.
